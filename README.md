# ACM_Algorithm_Study
I'll share some problems to do with algorithm. And share some of my thoughts about them. I'm also the one to learn algorithm so we can make progress together.

Because of the first year of my studying algorithm, some knowledge still can't be completely absorbed by me. Consequently, I hope that everyone who may visit my repositories could offer me some contributes or advice.

**I like using formulars to solve and express problems**, so in this repositoris mostly I'll express my comprehension of the algorithm with one markdown file and one cpp file which conclude both the codes and the formulars. And the Latex can't be used in Github Page, so I use the HTML to link the web to show the picture of the formular.

As for the language, emm..mostly I'll use Chinese which is my mother tongue, sometime maybe I'll use English when it's simpler.

If you're also the one who just studys ACM, come on, let's study together,my contact information is below.

One more thing, as for the new dark mode of github, some formulars which are showed as png can't be showed clearly. So make sure that you switch to the light mode before looking through the markdown files!
