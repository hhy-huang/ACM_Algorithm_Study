# ACM_Algorithm_Study
The repository was build and contributed initially by 1511 dormitory. And welcome more people come to join us in studying algorithm and sharing ideas about algorithm.

We'll share some problems to do with algorithm. And share some of our thoughts about them. We're also the one to learn algorithm so we can make progress together.

Because of the beginning of our studying algorithm, some knowledge still can't be completely absorbed or understood by us. Consequently, we hope that everyone who may visit our repositories could offer us some contributes or advice.

As for the language, emm..mostly we'll use Chinese which is our mother tongue, sometime maybe we'll use English when it's simpler.

And the sources of my learning are from the author Li Yudong who from Peking University and wrote the book 《算法进阶指南》.

If you're also the one who just studys ACM, come on, let's study together,our contact information is below.

One more thing, as for the new dark mode of github, some formulars which are showed as png can't be showed clearly. So make sure that you switch to the light mode before looking through the markdown files!
